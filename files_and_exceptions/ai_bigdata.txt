processing new ways to analyze and systematically extract information and deal with data sets gave birth to a new field
known as Big data.
Big data overwhelms businesses on day-to-day basis; data capturing, analysis, search, sharing, transfer, visualization,
querying, information privacy and data sourcing are some of the challenges businesses are faced with when dealing with
massive amount of data - structured and unstructured. But the importance of big data does not revolve with the amount of
data one might have but how it is used. Data when analyzed properly help businesses reduce costs and time on research
for new product development and optimized offerings, and aid in smarter decision making. When big data is combined with
high-powered analytics and Artificial intelligence industries are able to solve complex tasks such as:
