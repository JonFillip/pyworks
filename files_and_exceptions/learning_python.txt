I started learning about programming languages back in high school. I wanted to know more but the teacher handling the
IT languages course wasn't all that great and made things seem too complicated. Then in 2018, once I was in university
I picked up interest in programming again and began learning Python. I started with free courses in FreeCodeCamp on
YouTube, then stopped for a while and bought books to help me understand concepts that aren't always explained in certain
tutorials. I've learned stuff like:

1. Python data structure and data types
2. Variables and working with strings
3. conditional statements
4. Iterations, loops
5. List, dictionary, sets
6. Functions
7. Classes
8. Files
9. Methods, imports and modules
